    <h1> CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <h2>Difference between absolute and relative CSS length units</h2>
    <p>CSS uses length units, which may be either absolute or relative, to define how large components look.  Absolute units, such as pixels (px) and points (pt), are constant regardless of context or screen size.  Although they are precise, they are not device-neutral.  Conversely, relative units like lh, rlh, vw, and vh are more helpful in responsive design as they adjust according to external factors like font size or viewport dimensions.</p>
<p>For instance, pt, which is more frequently used in print styles, is the same as 1/72 of an inch, but px, which is the most widely used absolute measure, represents a single pixel on a screen.  On the other hand, lh and rlh are proportional to line height.  In order to assist maintain consistent vertical spacing throughout a webpage, lh matches the line height of the element itself, whereas rlh refers to the line height of the root element.</p>
    <p>Viewport-based units, such as vw and vh, adjust to the browser window's size.  1vw and 1vh are equivalent to 1% of the viewport's width and height, respectively.  In current web design, these units are frequently used to create full-screen portions or make sure that typography adjusts proportionately to window resizing.  They are crucial for layouts that are intended to appear nice on desktops and mobile devices because of their responsiveness.</p>
