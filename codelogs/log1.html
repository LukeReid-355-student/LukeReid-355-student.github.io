	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
	<h2> 1. Difference Non-semantic tags vs Semantic tags</h2>
	<p>Non-semantic tags, like 'div' and "span", do not describe the meaning of the content inside them, they are mainly used for styling or grouping. Semantic tags, such as "header", "article", "section", and "footer", describe the role or meaning of the content, making it clearer for both developers and browsers.

	</p>
	<p2> Semantic tags - like "header"", "nav", "article", "footer": Describe what the content is (a header,
		navigation, article, etc.).</p2>

		<h1>2. Benefits of Semantic Tags</h1>

		<p>Because screen readers and assistive devices can better comprehend the site structure thanks to semantic tags, accessibility is improved.  Because they make it easier for search engines to recognize and rank valuable material, they help improve SEO.  They also facilitate the reading and maintenance of code.</p>
